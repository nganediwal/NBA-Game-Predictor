Our team is building a model to predict the outcome of NBA basketball games. More specifically, we will use data from past NBA seasons to predict the winner of a particular match-up on a certain day. The best published models in this problem space have been able to achieve within the range of 65-75% accuracy, so we will aim to reach 65% accuracy of game predictions. We will use team features such as field goal percentage, ELO (overall rating of the team), and average win-loss rate over the past 10 games. We will be training the model using game statistics over past NBA seasons, as found in datasets on Kaggle as well as scraped from the web.
